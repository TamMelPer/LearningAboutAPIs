## Learning About APIs
 
 
As part of my self-led-learning journey at Makers, I wanted to  learn about APIs as they are completely foreign to me. There are a lot of resources out there but not many are truly beginner friendly. This is how I started to teach myself about Javascript and APIs.

 - [This](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-create-a-simple-web-app-using-javascript-d27b28459fad) blog which made APIs fun with Kanye West quotes and cat pictures. 
 - [Dog APIs](https://docs.thedogapi.com/) I added dog pictures as I'm more of a dog person :)
